# Terrain-Rendering
<p>This is the code for the terrain map on a rectangular grid and rendered a character to interactively walk over the landscape and implemented animation using Catmull-Rom Splines for recording the position, direction and time of the characters.</p>
<p>Character can move around the rectangular grid using arrow keys.</p>
<p>Designed a fog environment on the terrain map to avoid letting users know the end of the world by pressing F.</p>
<p>Added the functionality to toggle to GPU shader data structure by pressing G.</p>

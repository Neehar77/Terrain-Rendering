# Terrain-Rendering
### This is the code for the terrain map on a rectangular grid and rendered a character to interactively walk over the landscape and implemented animation using Catmull-Rom Splines for recording the position, direction and time of the characters.
### Character can move around the rectangular grid using arrow keys.
### Designed a fog environment on the terrain map to avoid letting users know the end of the world by pressing F.
### Added the functionality to toggle to GPU shader data structure by pressing G.
